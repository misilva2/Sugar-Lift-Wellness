# Copilot Instructions — Sugar-Lift-Wellness

## Project snapshot
- Repository appears minimal: only [README.md](README.md).
- Purpose (from README): official website for Sugar Lift Wellness, owned by Tiffany Silva.

## Architecture & structure
- No application source directories are present yet (no `src/`, `public/`, `app/`, etc.).
- There are no discoverable services, APIs, or data flows in the current repo state.

## Developer workflows
- No build, test, lint, or dev server commands are documented.
- No configuration files (package manager, framework, or tooling) are present.

## Conventions & patterns
- No project-specific coding conventions or patterns are discoverable.

## Guidance for changes in this repo
- If you add a framework or tooling, update README and include the exact commands (install, dev, build, test) so future agents can follow them.
- Prefer adding a conventional structure (e.g., `src/`, `public/`, `app/`) and document it in README for quick orientation.
- When introducing configuration, keep it minimal and name files clearly (e.g., `package.json`, `vite.config.*`, `next.config.*`).
